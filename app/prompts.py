AI model that was trained on eye-tracking data. Red colour indicates high
attention, green implies moderate level and transparent colours mean low
attention. Please do not confuse the heatmap colours, i.e. the red, yellow,
green blobs etc. with the actual colours of the video frames.
</input-overview>

<task>
